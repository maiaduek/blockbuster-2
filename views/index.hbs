<h3 class="about">Have you ever sat down on your comfy couch after a long day, ready to watch a movie and relax but you can't quite numb out just yet since you just don't know what to watch? Movie Tracker can help with that! <br>
<br>After you create an account, you'll be able to generate 20 random movies to choose from with the simple click of a button. Movie Tracker allows you to browse through these movies and read about some details such as the description, who stars in it, and the runtime, among other things.<br><br>
 If you love the movie, or just want to save it for later, you can add the movie to your favorites to make sure you don't forget about it. <br><br>
 Movie Tracker also allows you to keep track of your favorite snacks so you're well prepared for that very much deserved movie-watching session.<br><br>
